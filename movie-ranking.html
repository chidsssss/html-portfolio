<h1>MY best movies according to Chidera</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time will be listed on this website.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Wolf of wall street</h3>
<p>The plot of this movie was insane form start to finish, and to make it worse it was a real life story!!!</p>
<h3>The great gatsby</h3>
<p>very emotional movie which showcases the power of love. Im aware its the same lead actor for both movies but its just
    a coincidence</p>
<h3>Prince of Egypt</h3>
<p>This is the only animation that i am capable of watching over a hundered times without getting tired. The
    soundtrack>>>>></p>
